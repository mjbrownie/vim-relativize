 Project with a tags file example: 

               Open a long full path name from some error log 

                vi /some/full/path/to/project/current_project/lib/module/file.ext 
               ... 

               :Relativize tags<cr> 

               if you type :pwd you should get 

               /some/full/path/to/project/current_project 

               assuming a tags file has been created in the current_project 
               file in the past. 

               So hopefully this means tag jumps will work and relative 
               include paths can be accessed via gf. 

               This could also be useful for other landmark files on the 
               system (eg. index.html, tags, .project,build.xml,README...etc). 
               In the above example 
               using the actual file.ext as the argument will make the 
               working directory the module directory 

               The function will prioritise the deepest tags file. 

                I have this in my vimrc to give you some ideas 
                 
                nnoremap ,pp :split<cr>:enew<cr>:r! tail -n 1000 /var/log/php_errorlog<cr>:set buftype=nofile<cr>Gf/ 
                nnoremap gft gf:Relativize tags<cr> 
                nnoremap gfi gf:Relativize index.php<cr> 




         Bugs: 

               - Will probably not work with MS windows paths in current form. 
               It will probably cause an infinite loop you will need to 
               Ctrl-C out of.
